## Problem 1

Read & clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
trash_df <- 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(is.na(dumpster) == FALSE) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

Read & clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019

``` r
# Read and clean precipitation data for 2018
precip18_df <- 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)

# Read and clean precipitation data for 2019
precip19_df <- 
  read_excel(
    "data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
    range = "A2:B14") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)

# Combine two data frame & convert `month`
precip_df <- 
  bind_rows(precip18_df, precip19_df) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

There are `344` observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataframe after
cleanness and `18` in the second dataframe. And the key variables are
`month` and `year` since they are used in both data sets. The total
precipitation in 2018 is `70.33` and the median number of sports balls
in a dumpster in 2019 is `8.5`.
